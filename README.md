This repository includes the source code of the proposed MA algorithm published in an Information Sciences paper titled with "A memetic algorithm based on reformulation local search for minimum sum-of-squares clustering in networks".

The three sets of 72 benchmark instances consist of 40 instances from OR-LIB, 20 instances from TSP-LIB, and 12 instances from University of Florida Sparse Matrix (UFSM) Collection. To facilitate the further research, we upload the 40 pmed instances from OR-LIB here.
